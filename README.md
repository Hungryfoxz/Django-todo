# Django-todo
This is todo notes app build with Djnago and Materialize css

## Making
I made this app after learning a react project to create todo app. So decided to implement the same on Django.
And what i came up with is far better than what I achived with React. Don't get offended by this, truth is React is much better for the frontend i know but in this project it was 
not much about front end nor the backend.It eas achieved with just some django templates.

### If somehow you decide to run it on Your machine, Dont't worry I gotch'ya covered ->
First clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repostitory name .git>
```
Now cd into the directory :
```bash
cd Django_Todo
```

Run the below command :
```python 
python manage.py runserver
```
This by default will run on port localhost:8000 and you are ready to go.
